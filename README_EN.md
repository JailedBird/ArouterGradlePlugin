# ArouterGradlePlugin



## The reason for the review rejection

> We received your plugin submission for "cn.jailedbird.arouter".
>
> Your plugin was flagged for manual review because of the following issue(s):
>
> Plugin ID prefix 'cn.jailedbird.arouter' does not match the GitHub username 'JailedBird'. Please prove ownership of the "jailedbird.cn" domain by adding a TXT record with value "gradle-verification=21V75CTLKFT7ATKNMM1GS9INUOHN1" to your DNS, or use a plugin ID, which ties to your GitHub user id, for example "io.github.JailedBird.plugin"
>
> Your plugin lacks documentation, making its use by the community quite unlikely. If this is a private plugin, consider publishing it to a private repository.
> Please refer to our documentation on plugin approval guidelines for more information: https://plugins.gradle.org/docs/publish-plugin#approval

Leak document

> #### Plugin is lacking public documentation
>
> **One typical situation when this problem arises is when the website or VCS URLs provided during plugin publication point to a broken or inaccessible destination. Another one is when the URLs point to, for example, a public GitHub repository, but there is no documentation there (empty README file) or none of it is in English.**
>
> The problem with the lack of documentation is that it makes the adoption of the plugin by the community very unlikely.
>
> The solution to this problem is to either make the documentation publicly available, or, if your plugin is indeed private, consider publishing it to a private repository.
