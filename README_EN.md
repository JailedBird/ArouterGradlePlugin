# ArouterGradlePlugin

With this plugin, you can automatically register in the [ARouter](https://github.com/alibaba/ARouter) framework for AGP 7.4+ version. The usage is exactly the same as `com.alibaba:arouter-register`.

To import this plugin in the App module, you can find it on [plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org/u/zjc).

In the future, I will also support AGP 8.0+; however, please note that it is currently in beta version and may have performance issues. The correctness has been preliminarily verified. Please be aware that the minimum requirement is AGP 7.4, and it has not been tested with AGP 7.4+ yet (but adaptation is relatively easy). It is not compatible with AGP versions below 7.4.
